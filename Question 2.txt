Q. 
Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML document.


Ans.
Comments are used to add notes between the code for developers. They offer explanations, reminders, or instructions that do not affects the code in any way. These comments 
facilitate collaboration and improve code readability by providing insights into the codeâ€™s structure and purpose. They can also be used to simply document when was a code/
program made or by who. 

Comments are very important for developers. Comments improve code readability, aid in collaboration, and enable temporary disabling of code segments. These comments serve as 
invisible notes within the code. HTML comments start with '<!--' and end with '-->'. Comments can span to multiple lines and the syntax remains the same. 

Examples:
    
    1. Single line comment:
    
        <!-- This is a comment -->


    2. Multi line comments:

        <!-- This program shows a table that contains many ordered lists with style formatting done on them.
          Each ordered list has further nested unordered lists in them. These unordered lists will serve as
          the topics that will be covered -->

        
        <!--
