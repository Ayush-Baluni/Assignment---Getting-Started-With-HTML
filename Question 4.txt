Q. 
Write a short note on Tag and element with an example?


Ans.

1. Tags in HTML:
 
-> Tags are fundamental components of HTML that establish the structure and content of a webpage. They are surrounded by angle brackets (< >). Typically, 
HTML tags appear in pairs: an opening tag marks the beginning of an HTML element, and a closing tag denotes its end. For example, the <p> tag is used to 
create a paragraph, with the corresponding closing tag being </p>.

   There are two types of tags -

   a. Pair tags:
   -> These tags come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag starts the element, and the closing tag ends it. The content is 
      placed between these tags. 
      Forexample:

      'paragraph'(<p> & </p>), 'heading'(<h1> & </h1>), 'table'(<table> & </table>), 'ordered list'(<ol> & </ol>).

   b. Self closing tags -
   -> These tags do not have a closing tag. They are used to insert content or elements where there is no need for additional content between start and 
      end tags. For example:

      I. 'image" (<img>) - Embeds an image into the page. Requires the 'src' attribute to specify the image source.
      II. 'line break' (<br>) - Inserts a line break and starts a new line in the webpage
      III. 'horizontal line' (<hr>) - Inserts a horizontal line in the webpage


1. Elements in HTML:

-> An HTML element includes an opening tag, the content, and a closing tag. It encompasses all the content and any nested elements between the opening and 
closing tags. Elements can hold text, attributes, or other elements and define how the content is presented or organized. Basically, an element is every 
thing from the opening tag to the closing tag.

   There are two types of elements:

   a. Block-level elements:
   -> Block-level elements occupy the full width available and start on a new line. They create larger sections within a webpage. These elements can  also 
      contain other block-level elements and inline elements. For example:

      I. <h1>Main Heading</h1>
      II. <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
      III.  <ul>
                <li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li>
            </ul>

   b. Inline elements:
   -> Inline elements occupy only as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line. They are used to style or format parts of a line of text. Inline 
      elements cannot contain block-level elements but can include other inline elements. For example:

      I. <a href="https://pwskills.com">Visit Example</a>
      II. <strong>Important Text</strong>
      III. <span class="ABC">Hello, I am Ayush</span>
