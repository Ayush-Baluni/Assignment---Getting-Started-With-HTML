Q. 
What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?


Ans.
DOCTYPE is a declaration that is not an HTML tag. It is data for the browser so that it knows what document type to expect and what version of HTML 
the code is written in.
All HTML documents need to start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration varies depending on what version of HTML the document is written in.

In HTML 5, the declaration syntax is:

    ' <!DOCTYPE html> '

In HTML 4 strict, the declaration is:

    ' <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://example.com/html4/strict.dtd"> '


In XHTML 1.1, the declaration is:
    
    ' <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://example.com/xhtml11/xhtml11.dtd"> '
